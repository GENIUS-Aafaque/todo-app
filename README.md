## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

### Usage

   ```bash
   # For example, using Python:
   python -m http.server
   ```

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or another port as specified by the server).
